# Files used to make command shell more usable

+ cmdrc.cmd - acts as a profile / rc file
+ doskeys.cmd - mostly provides some bash / linux like familiarity
+ prompt.cmd - provides a more useful prompt that makes some nice visual separation from input and output
+ shortcuts.cmd - special doskeys to make navigation around my current project / env easier
